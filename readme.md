### Bookings View

There can be potential conflicts on settings.py, login.html, passenger_information.html and signup.html, and it boils down to bootstrap5. I have renamed it to django_bootstrap5 for now so that I can test my changes, but this can cause problem with merging to main.

Also, there are some changes to requirements.txt, which can cause some conflicts. I have not changed this file; maybe Python-Django made some backhand changes.
